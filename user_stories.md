* As a bus-mall employee I want to be provided all the statistics but I do not want to show these statistics to the User but only they have liked 25 images.

* As a bus-mall employee I want the user to provide preference of images depend on which image was clicked on. This means that while some images will be shown multiple times, the duplications can no be on the displayed images nor the images that were shown immediately before. So not duplication in a row. Two sets of unique images have be shown back to back. The third set could potential have some of the picture duplicated from previous showing.
